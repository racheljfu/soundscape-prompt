Soundscape Reflection Part 1

My soundscape so far has proven to be pretty interesting. It's exciting to 
see how I can make sounds come together linearly, but it can be hard to get 
them layered exactly the way I want them. Sometimes, it's hard to record
something if there's a lot of background noise, and since my soundscape 
uses a lot of "city" sounds there tends to be a lot of that. For example,
I'm trying to capture the sound of the fan / generator in my dorm, which is 
really loud, but because of all the air it blows around, it can be hard to get 
the actual sound of the machinery. I'm also trying to edit a video of my 
friend skateboarding down a hill, but when layered over a track of 
riding the bus, it's pretty hard to hear. Plus, the sound of air resistance and wind
in the background of the skateboarding clip is hard to fix to sound correct, and
I don't want to record another skateboarding down a hill video in Pittsburgh. 
It can also be hard to tell exactly what the sounds are if you're not in
that specific location (ex: water dripping, dorm fan are most recognizable
to people who live in my dorm only). 

Things that make a soundscape work well: 
* sense of motion and continuity
* "universal" ability to recognize the sounds
* (also, specificity of certain sounds ex: cathedral elevator) 
* immersivity
