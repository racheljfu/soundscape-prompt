# Soundscape Narrative
Rachel Wonder

## Just some thoughts
**My title (as of now):** Pittsburgh's Not My Home

My soundscape narrative will focus on the concept of homesickness and lonesomeness in an urban environment: 
* How can one feel alone amidst so many people and sounds? 
* How does homesickness manifest in everyday life? 
* How does one mediate that loneliness? 

**Some details about the narrative:**
* I'll act as the main character of the narrative, a new student (supposedly at Pitt).
* The narrator will start off feeling totally alone, preoccupied with the loneliness of the city and memories of home. 
* Over time, she will connect with her environment more positively by channeling the happiness of her past into the present. 
* In the end, she'll be more in-tune and content with her surroundings. 

**The main types of sounds to be used (very generally):**
* City sounds
* Suburban sounds
* Voices - people talking to themselves and each other
* Music (possibly?)
