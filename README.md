# Soundscape Narrative

## My title:

**Some concepts and ideas I play with in the soundscape:**
* solitude
* monotony
* waiting / expectations
* memory
* telephone as means of communication
* intermingling of past / present experience

**Basic summary of the narrative:**
* The main character (presumably Rachel herself) starts off in a (run-down?) dorm, eating alone, and placing a phone call. 
* As she leaves the dorm and walks out onto the street, she finds that her call is unanswered. 
* "What AM I waiting for?" 
* After waiting a bit, she takes a 71D.
* She starts to remember all the people who have left her voicemails, and other instances of her home. 
* Set to the tune of airy music and the lull of the bus, she eventually comes back to her dorm, feeling a greater sense of community.
