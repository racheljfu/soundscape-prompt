											The gentle and steady plinking of water onto ceramic. 
						Somewhere in this room, a faucet must have been left unattended—or otherwise, unrepaired. 

																								  A phone call is being placed... 
																												(beep)

Three dings of a microwave: this is the food that is done cooking.

Cutlery and its chime against bowls and plates, when one is eating.

										Connect Cards as passengers board the bus--ding, ding, ding.
											The low hum of the bus drifting against the wind....
															Drifting...
											Skateboard wheels drifting--rattling--over concrete. 
												Faraway, airy music, like a summer breeze. 
												
A gentle voice, as the caller remembers. "Do a kickflip!"
Actually, please don’t. 
...
NO!!"
Another voice; its speaker smirks. “Does kickflip.” 
															
												Can you still hear the hum of the bus?

The same gentle voice: "Hi, let me know when you want to go to lunch.

														  The bus and music hum on.
An older woman: "Hey Rachel, it's Yiayia. Hey, 				   Drifting...

Walk sign is on to cross-

The ding of an ascending elevator. 
Ding. Ding. Ding. 
A card locking into the slot of a door. 																		"Hi Rachel, it's Daniel,
