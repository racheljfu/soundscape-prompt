The gentle and steady plinking of water onto ceramic. Somewhere in this room, a faucet must have been left unattended—or otherwise, unrepaired. 

																								  A phone call is being placed...

Three dings of a microwave: this is the food that is done cooking.

Cutlery and its chime against bowls and plates, when one is eating.

Closing the door—lightly, to avoid slamming.   						
The faucet and its song fades to obscurity.

dingdingding of Connect Cards as passengers board the bus. 

The low whine of the bus drifting against the wind....
Drifting...
Skateboard wheels drifting--rattling--over concrete. 

									Faraway, airy music, like a summer breeze. 
														A gentle voice. Now the caller remembers. "Do a kickflip! 
																Actually, please don’t. 
																	(A pause). NO!”
															Another voice; its speaker smirks. “Does kickflip.” 
															
The bus is still moving. 

														The same gentle voice:
														“Hi, let me know when you want to go to lunch. 
														I’m in Harrisburg. 
														There’s currently a drag show...
														for...
														children...
														Okay. Bye.”

“Hi Rach, it’s Mom. Give me a call back then, wanna see how things are going. Buh-bye.” 
“Rachel, it’s Yiayia. Hey, would it be better if we made the spanakopita .”
“Hey Rachie, I just sent you a Tiktok video I think you should look at. I think it’s a good representation of what we’re going to look like. 
“Hi Rachel, it’s Pop. Hey, we want to take you out to lunch to the...noodle factory? Give me a call. 
“Hey Rachel, sorry I didn’t check up earlier. Contact me when you can, I love you very much.”
