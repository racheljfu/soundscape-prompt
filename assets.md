## CREATED ASSETS
**Street sounds** 
* vehicles coming and going, traffic signals, chatter, people ordering food, the wind, etc. 
* riding the bus: "stop requested," tapping card to pay, people moving around, "driving sounds"
	1. Go outside, walk around, and record these (relatively easy to do)
	
**Dorm sounds** 
* faucets dripping, opening the window, washing dishes, doors creaking. 
	1. Go to my dorm and record these (pretty easy, don't need permission from anyone)
	
**Old sound recordings from home**
* Friends laughing, playing instruments, dogs barking, anything else I can find
	1. Use audio from videos with friends and family that we previously recorded (and ask permission)
	2. Videos / voice memos I already have that I recorded myself
	
**Phone call sounds**
* ringing, "please leave a message," text message notifications, voicemails
	1. Ask permission to download people's voicemails / create new ones w / people
** Voices to provide narration / sense of character **
	1. I will use my own, plus get permission from friends to use theirs. 
	2. Possibly record a phone call to get a different sound than normal (w/permission of course) 

## REPURPOSED ASSETS
** Music **
* Faraway, summery, whimsical-sounding music
	1. I was thinking of a sound like some songs by The Beach Boys or Gorillaz (but look at royalty-free stuff) 
	2. Music will be edited to sound more like it's in the background / muffled (most likely)
	
** Voicemails / video clips from friends / other voices **
* Will ask permission, as mentioned in Created Assets section
