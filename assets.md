## CREATED ASSETS
**Dorm sounds**
* Faucet drips
* Microwave beep 
* Elevator beeping (it sounds the same both going up and down) 
* "Eating sounds:" in other words, the sound of a utensil clanging against the bowl (this was me eating noodles)
* Closing door
* Opening door (requires card and pinpad input instead of keys)

**Phone call sounds**
* "beep" noise heard when placing a phone call
* automatic voicemail message ("Your call has been forwarded..."
	* (By the way, the number it reads out is my own. I called my own phone from my Google Voice number to trigger this message).

**Voices**
* My own voice used for the lines:
		1. The sighing / exhale (if that counts)
		2. "What am I waiting for?"
		3. "Hey dad, can you get me a towel, for the dishes?" 
		(I distorted all instances of my voice with the equalizer / high pass and low pass filters / reverb, etc.) 
	
**Street sounds** 
* Sounds of cars and bus moving 
* 5th at University walk signal
* Forbes avenue walk signal
* Walking sounds (made by tapping my foot)
* The walk sign "ticking"
* Motorcycles revving
* High-pitched sound of the bus pulling up
* 71D Hamilton alert 
	(I actually mixed two separate clips together for this: the 71D part comes from a bus that was going downtown.)
* Background chatter from the quad, Lawrence Hall, 
* "Stop requested" sound 
* Windy white noise (ish) (this was the sound of me opening and closing the window)

* vehicles coming and going, traffic signals, chatter, people ordering food, the wind, etc. 
* riding the bus: "stop requested," tapping card to pay, people moving around, driving sounds
	
**Home sounds**
* "Skateboarding sounds" (this was from a video of my friend Floey skateboarding down a hill and then pushing off)
* My dog barking
* Rinsing / washing dishes (I made this in my dorm but I layered it with the voice track to make it sound like it was at home). 
* Crickets chirping
