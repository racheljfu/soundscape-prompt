## SOUNDSCAPE PREVIEW EXPLANATION
**As of: Tuesday Sept 10 

My preview that's attached in this repository serves to introduce the life of the narrator.
As I've briefly in my readme and assets files,
** my soundscape narrative is going to...
* follow a new student (presumably at Pitt)
* who is feeling totally alone, 
* preoccupied with the lonesomeness of the city and her homesickness. 
* Over time, she'll connect her past to the present and 
* and realize that her happiness doesn't have to stay in the past.


In this first preview of it, I'm mostly going to focus on the second and third bullet points on that list. 
My narrator will start off in her dorm, then navigate through campus and the city streets.
So far I've planned to use sounds that have a rhythmic monotony to them, 
**such as:
* clinking a spoon in a bowl
* water dripping from a faucet
* elevator going down 
* steady footsteps 
* crosswalk signal beeping.
(these are mostly layered to some extent but I haven't made it pretty yet) 
(i have done some effects though, with amplify and noise reduction mostly)
** TO ADD: sound of a/c in the hallway in the dorm (provides sense of continuity)

I'll include a short line of dialogue, which will encapsulate the narrator's inner thoughts at the moment. 
(I also want to start playing some music; it might improve the nostalgic feel that I want to communicate). 
There will be a transition to her memories of the past in her suburban community at home.
To make a more seamless transition, I will start with some monotonous sounds that could
be interpreted as suburban or urban, but transition into more distinct ones (ex: human voices)
** Here's what I'm thinking so far:
* crickets chirping
* eating in a room
* skateboarding + friends talking
* phone ringing / voicemail from family or friend
(still need to upload these) 

After this, I might have the narrator talk to someone briefly, or meet up 
with a friend at home. I haven't exactly planned this part out,
but I do know I want to head in an optimistic direction.
